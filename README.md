### To do

* Fix any errors that may be found over time.
* Keep updating with new boards and mounting styles.

### Sources for some measurements

These were used for USB cut outs and stabilizers respectively, altered in some way.

* Yuktsi's original A17 files
* Zambumon's Lubrigante files

### Final note

I am providing these files free of charge, hence should anything happen during manufacturing or there are errors spotted, I am not one to be held accountable. Should you have any issues, please message me on discord at cinna#4754 and I can update the files ASAP. More pics will be included in the future. These files are likely always going to be WIP until they reach a level where issues are not reported. A lot of issues from previous protos have been fixed, but nothing is concrete.
