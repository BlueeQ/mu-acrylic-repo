Î¼ series of boards in acrylic format

### Introduction
These are boards I've created mainly for personal use and to be able to develop boards with a similar design aesthetic to one another, varying mounting methods may apply for each board. Details on how to build will be within each description or folder.

### Alpha
60% with the ability to be gasket mounted via strips, or used with a 5mm acrylic plate. Allows for standoffs.

### Epsilon
TKL consisting of same design, 5mm acrylic plate only for now. Testing files are included in the repo, but DO NOT use them until they have moved.

### Upsilon
CP1800, same design. 5mm acrylic plate as well as a relief cut 1.5mm plate + mid insert, PCB design is underway. Gasket mount may be coming at a later date.

### Upcoming designs
* Nu - Blockered 65%, both gasket and sandwich mount. Same design aspects.
* Unnamed Alice - Same design, potentially gasket. 
* Unnamed 75 - Same design, possibly split.
