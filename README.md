# μ-acrylic-repo
μ series of boards in acrylic format


# Upsilon was deleted. Did not fit my design style. May be remade once a PCB design has been produced.

### Introduction
These are boards I've created mainly for personal use and to be able to develop boards with a similar design aesthetic to one another, varying mounting methods may apply for each board. Details on how to build will be within each description or folder.

### Alpha
60% with the ability to be gasket mounted via strips, or used with a 5mm acrylic plate. Allows for standoffs.

* Unnamed 75 - Same design, possibly split. Layout likely similar to the G80-5000.

### To do

* Fix any errors that may be found over time.
* Keep updating with new boards and mounting styles.

### Sources for some measurements

These were used for USB cut outs and stabilizers respectively, altered in some way.

* Yuktsi's original A17 files
* Zambumon's Lubrigante files

### Final note

I am providing these files free of charge, hence should anything happen during manufacturing or there are errors spotted, I am not one to be held accountable. Should you have any issues, please message me on discord at cinna#4754 and I can update the files ASAP. More pics will be included in the future. These files are likely always going to be WIP until they reach a level where issues are not reported. A lot of issues from previous protos have been fixed, but nothing is concrete.
