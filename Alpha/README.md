Any type of foam or silicone can be used, this board was made for experimenting with
different materials. Make sure you get something that can be compressed enough and is
~5mm or less than depending on compression of said material.

*** Standoff sizes

Lower standoffs - 
Upper standoffs - 
Screw sizes - M3 * 

Feet go in ascending order, onto the bottom piece. Next is the bottom mid. Above is the gasket mid or acrylic plate depending on which you choose to go for. Finally the top. Standoffs go inbetween top and bottom layers, with the ones towards the top being bigger to account for feet. Gasket strips can be applied to either the plate or bottom mid in between where the gasket mid has cut outs.
