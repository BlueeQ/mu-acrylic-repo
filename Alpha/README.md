# Alpha build guide

### Acrylic sizes needed:

* Feet - 3mm
* Bottom - 3mm
* Bottom mid - 5mm
* Gasket mid (only required for gasket) - 5mm
* Gasket plate (only required for gasket) - 1.5mm
* 5mm plate (only required for full acrylic) - 5mm
* Top WK/WKL/HHKB - 8mm

Any type of foam or silicone can be used, this board was made for experimenting with
different materials. Make sure you get something that can be compressed enough and is
~5mm or less than depending on compression of said material.

### Standoff sizes

* Lower standoffs - 
* Upper standoffs - 
* Screw sizes - M3 * 

Feet go in ascending order, onto the bottom piece. Next is the bottom mid. Above is the gasket mid or acrylic plate depending on which you choose to go for. Finally the top. Standoffs go inbetween top and bottom layers, with the ones towards the top being bigger to account for feet. Gasket strips can be applied to either the plate or bottom mid in between where the gasket mid has cut outs.

### In more simple terms:

* Smallest foot
* Mid food
* Largest foot
* Bottom
* Bottom mid
* 5mm plate/gasket mid + plate
* Top

# ONLY GET SOUTH FACING ENTER IF YOU HAVE A PCB THAT REQUIRES IT, MOST PCBS SUPPORT NORTH FACING.

### To do:

* Upload FR4 plates after changing cutout size, some switches too tight as of now (mainly holy pandas).
* Add renders of all top configurations.
* Update version number on the bottom piece.

### Typing tests

* Acrylic plate - https://youtu.be/9bhwww4_kcY
* Gasket + PBT caps - https://youtu.be/gE-rqWvAcaQ
* Gasket + ABS caps - https://youtu.be/v6h2yQDoV24

### Please note that typing tests are not a realistic representation of a board.
