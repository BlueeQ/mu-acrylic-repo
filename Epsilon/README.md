# Epsilon build guide

### Current issues being worked on

* Needs cut adding on mid piece to allow for USB port to not touch it, will work as is but needs dremelling a little.

### Files notes

Should you want the most compatibility with the board, you can go for Bottom (bottom USB) and the standard plate, these were made so that they are more aesthetically pleasing (mainly the plate), though it allows you to use either top or bottom mount USB in the future should you have to swap PCB, the choice is ultimately yours.

### Acrylic sizes needed:

* Feet - 3mm
* Bottom - 3mm
* Mid - 5mm
* Acrylic plate - 5mm
* Top WK/WKL - 8mm

### Standoff sizes

* Lower standoffs - 
* Upper standoffs - 
* Screw sizes - M3 * 

Feet go in ascending order, onto the bottom piece. Next is the mid. Above is the acrylic plate. Finally the top. Standoffs go inbetween top and bottom layers, with the ones towards the top being bigger to account for feet.

### In more simple terms, starting from the bottom:

### Full acrylic build
